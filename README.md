Spacecore is a financial administration tool targeted at hackerspaces.

# Project status

The application is far from feature complete and still in active development. Currently Spacecore is mostly functional as a point-of-sale and management system for a canteen. It is being used for that exact purpose at the TkkrLab hackerspace in Enschede, the Netherlands. Come visit us if you're in the area :smiley:

Use at your own risk!

# Structure

The application is divided into three components: models describing types of objects, controllers for managing the objects and views that describe the API through which the objects can be used.
